Pygame Rocket Simulation

This project simulates rockets attempting to reach a target while avoiding obstacles using a Genetic Algorithm. Rockets evolve over generations to optimize their paths.

Features
- Rockets are controlled by genomes consisting of thrust vectors.
- Genetic Algorithm includes selection, crossover, and mutation.
- Fitness evaluation based on distance to the target and collision avoidance.
- Dynamic display of the population's fitness statistics.
